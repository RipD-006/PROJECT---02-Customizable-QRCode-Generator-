# PROJECT---02-Customizable-QRCode-Generator-
This Python project is designed to generate QR codes based on user input. The application takes a string such as a URL, text, or any other form of data and converts it into a QR code image, which can then be saved or displayed. It allows for customization in terms of size, error correction level, and the color of the QR code.
